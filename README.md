[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CustomIRCd/sIRCd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CustomIRCd/sIRCd)

**sIRCd** is a high performance, lightweight, and scalable
IRC daemon. It is a fork of the now-defunct ShadowIRCD and seeks to continue in
the direction ShadowIRCD was headed.

Debian packages:

 - `libssl-dev`

 - `bison`
 - `build-essential`

## Debian/ubuntu Users

You should run `apt-get update` followed by `apt-get install libssl-dev flex bison build-essential`

Read the included documentation for detailed compilation and install
directions.
